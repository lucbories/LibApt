WELCOME !

LIBAPT aka A PHP Toolkit library is a project to help to create web applications (on the internet or into the enterprise) with less code as possible.
The concept is to declare db connexions, datas models, display views, page menus, configure the index.php and GO ! The application is running.

For instance, LIBAPT is still in development but runable.
It is very usefull for applications with databases access and with table presentation.

LIBAPT use PHP / HTML / CSS / JAVASCRIPT. The limit between server side or browser side code is very difficult to find in every situations and is still moving. So some code display initial state from PHP code but refresh the view in browser side. That's a point of progess.

If you need to write a browser side javascrip application, LIBAPT isn't the best way, see others full javascript toolkits.
But if you need to write a server and browser side application with datas access, LIBAPT can help you.
Be carefull, LIBAPT use declarative concept so you write wonfiguration files but not all the code.
You can provide an application with databases access without writing any code : write db/models/views/menus configuration files html templates and update the index.php and load.php, that's all !
